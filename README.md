# What is MVC (in PHP) and how is it structured?
---
I am looking for the answer to this in this video.

This course is amazing! Not only does MVC show what it is, but Brad also puts one into the basics in practice from scratch. 

[Object Oriented PHP & MVC](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc "PHP MVC from scratch")
**Build a custom object oriented PHP MVC framework and then build an application with it**
**Tutorial by Brad Traversy**
